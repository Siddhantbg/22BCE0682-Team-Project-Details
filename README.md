ABOUT US-We are a dedicated electronic repair company specializing in laptops and mobile phones, offering services for both official and third-party repairs. Our fundamental goal is to provide efficient solutions for all your electronic repair needs.

For official repairs, customers provide us with the purchase invoice, enabling us to negotiate on their behalf and provide a competitive quote. We profit from this service by either charging a convenience fee or partnering with authorized resellers on a commission-based model, where the commission varies based on the overall service cost.

However, for urgent situations like immediate laptop repairs, where official repairs may not be feasible, we prioritize third-party repairs. In this scenario, we collaborate with trusted repair shops, leveraging our connections to ensure quality service. Similarly, we operate on a commission-based model, capitalizing on the urgency of the situation to potentially achieve higher margins.

At our core, we understand the urgency and importance of having your devices functioning optimally, especially in critical situations like impending deadlines or urgent assignments. With our expertise and network, we strive to provide swift, reliable, and cost-effective repair solutions, ensuring your devices are up and running when you need them the most.
